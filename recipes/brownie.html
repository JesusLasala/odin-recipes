    <h2>Best ever chocolate brownies recipe</h2>
    
    <p>My confidence in my baking abilities is typically unshakeable.
        I have mastered carrot cake and oatmeal cookies. My pumpkin 
        cheesecake is fluffy and creamy. But I have never been more 
        humbled by a baked good than I was by brownies.</p>
    
    <p>So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle Lopez’s new book 
        Weeknight Baking, her recipe for Boxed Mix Brownies, From 
        Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able to make homemade 
        brownies that would be just as delicious as the ones from a box?</p>
